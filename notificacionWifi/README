This is a simple script in Python I've coded to watch for new users connected to my wlan.

Note that I've made this to work just on my actual router Firmware: NetGear CG3100D with V5.5.4.mp2_R09b

I guess it will work with different firmware and the same router, for different routers the RegExp will be different.
Note as well that my subnet is hardcoded.

Requeriments:

Linux -> notify-send
Python3?
